I routinely come across this error when dealing with large video files:

"Warning                         : End of processing at large atom (LargeFileSupport not enabled)"

And have figured it out in the past, but now is the time to actually document how to fix it:


One work around is to paste the following command after "exiftool" in command line, but before the file name: -api largefilesupport=1

Example:

Output a list of info from mp4s in a directory:

exiftool -api largefilesupport=1 -r "*.MP4" > results2.txt
