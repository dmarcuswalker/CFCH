Change ~/Documents to the Folder where the files reside (assumes that the csv file and the jpg files are in the same Folder):


     #!/bin/bash



     cd ~/Documents

     while read line          

     do          

          OldImageName=${line%,*}

          NewImageName=${line#*,}

          mv "$OldImageName" "$NewImageName"

     done <"TheFile.csv"
