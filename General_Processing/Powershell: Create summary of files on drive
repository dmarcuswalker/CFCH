This script makes a CSV of the files in a directory, listing out file name (and folder name), file count (in folders), size, directory path. Save the script below as a ".ps1" file and run by opening Windows Powershell and dragging in this script file. Voila!
2021-05-11: this script only looks at the first level of files/folders so it doesn't show info about the files WITHIN folders... Should try to figure this out!

An easy way to do this is simply "dir /a/s > filelist.txt" for the most basic output in command prompt
