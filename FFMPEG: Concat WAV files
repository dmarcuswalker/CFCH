I would start by converting the mono file to "stereo":

ffmpeg -i mono.wav -ac 2 mono2.wav

Then create a list of files you want concatenated in a test file, as so (saved as concat_files.txt)
file mono2.wav
file stereo.wav

Then this command should concat and produce the required output

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i concat_files.txt -c copy concat_file.wav
