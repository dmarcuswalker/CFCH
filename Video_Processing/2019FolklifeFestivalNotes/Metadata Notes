For some Sony cameras, the device ID can be extracted using the "-DeviceManufacturer" and "-DeviceModelName" tags in Exiftool
The following cameras were identified from SFF 2019:
Sony	ILCE-7M3 (Alpha 7 III)
Sony	ILCE-7RM2 (Alpha 7R II)
Sony	ILCE-7SM2 (Alpha 7S II)

For Canon cameras, the device ID shows up under "-CanonModelID" and also under the generic "-Model"
EOS 5D Mark IV

For Fujifilm camera, the device ID shows up under "-Model" as well but it doesn't list brand; brand is under the "-Make" tag
FUJIFILM X-T3

Panasonic camera, device ID shows up under "-Model" and brand name is under "-Make"
Panasonic DMC-GX85

BlackMagic camera, device ID doesn't show up in any standard fields, just "ComBlackmagic-designCameraCameraType" which is
Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K

For the Sony FS7, the camera metadata is stored in the sidecar xmp file. The device ID is stored under "-CameraModel" as well as "-Make" and "-Model"
Sony PXW-FS7



Conclusions: for the Sony FS-7, it might make sense to batch apply the metadata from the XMP to the MXF. Maybe try to write the tags
