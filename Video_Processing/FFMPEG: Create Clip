Simple command to create an excerpt based upon time stamps (note: doesn't work for MP4's!)

ffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -to 00:01:00 -i [filename] -acodec copy -vcodec copy [clipname]



FOR M4V and MP4's, use the following (make sure the output file is mp4:

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:05:10 -to 00:15:30 -c:v copy -c:a copy output2.mp4
